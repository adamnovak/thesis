\chapter{Introduction}

% Biology only works at scale

    % Scale in population and in time is what allows evolution to work
    
    % Scale produces drug resistance in bacteria
    
    % Scale produces cancer in healthy people
    
    % We won't be able to understand biology until we can match its scale

% High throughput is along the wrong dimension (so far)
    
    % We have a lot of features of a few samples.
    
    % To some extent we can get by with clever algorithms and educated guesses as prior knowledge.

% We need to be able to handle millions or even billions of samples if we want to be able to do biology just by looking.

    % Cancer, for example, won't make sense until we do this
    
% We need to be able to do this with something not millions of times better than current computing hardware

     % Because the transistors are now nearly as small as the stuff we're sequencing

% We can't scale that big by pushing BAM files around.

    % A billion 100-gig BAM files is 93 exabytes. That is too big to download.

% 1 in a million things start to happen, and we need infrastructure to handle them
    
    % We need to handle overlapping variants
    
    % We can't just throw out the alternate haplotypes
    
    % Assuming that everyone is contiguous in reference genome coordinates is going to get us into trouble
    
    % We can't keep messing around with the reference coordinates because we can't keep re-mapping every single read ever read.
    
    % We'll want to look at important variation in repetitive areas, and we may not yet have long reads

% So I'm going to build some stuff we will need in order to make this work
    
    % A non-linear coordinate system with stable base identifiers
    
    % A reference graph
    
        % Can capture more than just a single reference sequence
        
        % Reduce mapping bias
        
        % Probably less racist
        
    % A deterministic way to identify observed bases within that graph
        
    % A hierarchy of different versions of this graph with differing levels of specificity
        
        % Interlinked so you can project up and down for a rigorous notion of multimaping
        
% Then I'm going to try it out and discover something useful.
